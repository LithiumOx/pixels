# Pixels

Pixels is a program that allows you to convert any image into JSON format that can be sent to a server. The server can then print the image in real-time on a canvas that multiple clients can see. The program requires Node.js 18 to run and can be started by running `pnpm start`.

## Installation

Before running the program, you need to ensure that Node.js 18 and pnpm are installed on your system. If you do not have Node.js 18, you can download it from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/. To install pnpm, you can run the following command:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

Once Node.js and pnpm are installed, you can download or clone the Pixels repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/pixels.git
```

Next, navigate to the `pixels` directory and install the required dependencies using pnpm:

```
cd pixels
pnpm install
```

## Usage

To use the Pixels program, run the following command:

```
pnpm start
```

This will start the program and prompt you to select an image. Once you have selected an image, the program will automatically convert it to JSON format and start sending it to the server. The server will then print the image in real-time on a canvas that multiple clients can see.
